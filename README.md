## Safety Encrypt – API Gateway

This repository contains the API Gateway for the Safety Encrypt platform.

The API Gateway is the central entry point for all requests coming from the Safety Encrypt mobile app, routing them to the appropriate backend microservices, including:

- Crypto Service – handles encryption, decryption, password hashing, and more
- Auth Service – manages authentication and authorization
- Other services (planned) for reporting, notifications, and analytic
